# RL Assignment 4: Continuous Control (SAC, PPO, TD3)

**CMPS458: Reinforcement Learning (Fall 2025)** **Computer Engineering Department - Cairo University**

This repository contains implementations of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithms for continuous action-space environments. The goal is to train agents using PyTorch and publish the results to the Hugging Face RL leaderboard.

## 📌 Assignment Overview

The objective of this assignment is to solve **continuous control** problems using three specific algorithms:
1.  **SAC** (Soft Actor-Critic)
2.  **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization)
3.  **TD3** (Twin Delayed DDPG)

### Environments
The agents are trained on the following Gymnasium Box2D environments:
* `LunarLander-v3` (`continuous=True`)
* `CarRacing-v3` (`continuous=True`)
